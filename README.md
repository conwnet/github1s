# github1s

One second to read GitHub code with VS Code.

[Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github1s/lodjfmkfbfkpdhnhkcdcoonghhghbkhe/)

Or Save as a bookmarklet (GitHub markdown doesn't allow js links, just copy it into a bookmark) 

```
javascript: window.location.href = window.location.href.replace('github.com', 'github1s.com')
```

## Usage

Just add `1s` after `github` and press `Enter` in browser address bar for any repository you want to read.

For Example VS Code:

[https://github1s.com/microsoft/vscode](https://github1s.com/microsoft/vscode)
